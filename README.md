A wise man once said "never say never", but the fool didn't understand and went on his way.
Later, the fool discovered his enormous masochism and tripped on the stone he always said he would
never trip on. And that's how I ended up becoming a NixOS user.

For the time being, I continue to configure my software in the traditional way. Those configurations reside in the `etc` directory, and my NixOS configuration resides in the `nixos` directory. The `share` directory is self-explanatory.
